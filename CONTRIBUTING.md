# Contributing to fck - Work in Progress

Welcome, or whatever, to the fck framework. We begrudgingly acknowledge your interest in contributing to this project. Before you get started (if you really must), please take a moment to review the guidelines below. Not that it matters.

## Code of Conduct

Oh joy, this project follows a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Read it or don't, whatever. Just do something throughout your contribution process, like you care or something.

## Reporting Issues

If, by some miracle, you find any bugs, issues, or have suggestions (as if we care), please open an [issue](https://github.com/darkterminal/fck/issues) on GitHub. Ensure you provide detailed information about the problem you encountered or the improvement you're proposing. But really, who has time for that?

## Making Contributions

We reluctantly welcome contributions in the form of bug fixes, enhancements, or new features. Here's a simple guide to help you get started:

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Fork the fck repository on GitHub, because why not, right?

2. **Clone Your Fork:**
   - Clone your forked repository to your local machine because we can't do it for you.

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/fck.git
     ```

3. **Create a Branch:**
   - Create a new branch for your contribution because, apparently, we need more of that.

     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature-or-fix-name
     ```

4. **Make Changes:**
   - Make your changes to the codebase. Ensure your commits are descriptive, like we care about your "descriptive commit message."

     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "feat: your fck descriptive commit message"
     ```

   - Note: We encourage a respectful tone in commit messages. Please avoid the use of offensive language and **MAKE SURE THE COMMIT MESSAGE CONTAINS "fck" WORD or YOUR COMMIT WILL BE DECLINE**. Not that you have anything interesting to say.

5. **Push Changes:**
   - Push your changes to your fork on GitHub because we need more of your "contributions."

     ```bash
     git push origin feature-or-fix-name
     ```

6. **Open a Pull Request:**
   - Open a pull request from your fork to the main fck repository, if you must.

7. **Review and Merge:**
   - Once your pull request is submitted, it will be reviewed. If changes are requested, make them as needed. Once approved, your changes will be merged. Hooray.

Thank you, or whatever, for contributing to the fck framework! Your efforts are, begrudgingly, appreciated. Or something.

# fck - Work in Progress

Welcome to my fck framework! This project is a *work in progress* and is being developed just for fun. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and aims to provide a structured and modular codebase for web development.

## Project Overview

This fck framework is designed to showcase my dancing knowledge, experiment with different features, and serve as a playground for trying out new (old) ideas. Please note that this project is not intended for production use (yet), and some features may be incomplete or under development.

## Features

- **MVC Architecture**: The project follows the MVC architectural pattern for better organization and separation of concerns.
- **Routing**: Custom routing system to handle URL requests and map them to appropriate controllers and actions.
- **Views and Templates**: Implementation of views and templates to render dynamic content.
- **Controller Actions**: Handling user requests through controller actions for different routes.
- **Database Integration**: (If applicable) Integration with a database for data storage and retrieval.

   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd fck
   ```

3. **Run a Local Development Server:**

# fck - Work in Progress

Welcome to my fck! This project is a work in progress and is being developed just for fun. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and aims to provide a structured and modular codebase for web development.

## Project Overview

This fck is designed to showcase my coding skills, experiment with different features, and serve as a playground for trying out new ideas. Please note that this project is not intended for production use, and some features may be incomplete or under development.

## Features

- **MVC Architecture**: The project follows the MVC architectural pattern for better organization and separation of concerns.
- **Routing**: Custom routing system to handle URL requests and map them to appropriate controllers and actions.
- **Views and Templates**: Implementation of views and templates to render dynamic content.
